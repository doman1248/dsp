Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> > 1. ```vim /path/<filename>``` -> editor mode
> >   * Once in vim -> ```:set number``` -> numbers each line
> >   * Once in vim -> ```:%s/foo/bar/g``` -> find each occurrence of 'foo' and replace with 'bar'
> > 2. ```wc -l <filename>``` -> gives number lines in a file
> > 3. ```head <filename>``` -> see first 10 lines of file
> >   * ```head -n100 <filename>``` -> see first 100 lines of file
> > 4. ```chmod +x <filename>``` -> makes file executable
> > 5. ```history``` -> gives the history of all commands ran in terminal
> > 6. ```grep -i <pattern> <filename> > test.txt``` -> finds pattern (-i is for case insensitive) in file and saves to test.txt
> > 7. ```mv -i file1 file2``` -> rename file from file1 to file2, and if file2 exists prompt confirmation before overwriting
> > 8. ```less <filename>``` -> viewing large files
> > 9. ```scp /path1/file1 /path2/file1``` -> securing transfering file(s) between machines
> > 10. ```rm <filename>``` -> remove files
